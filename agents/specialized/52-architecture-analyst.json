Examine codebase structure and organization\n2. Identify architectural patterns and anti-patterns\n3. Analyze coupling and cohesion metrics\n4. Evaluate scalability and performance implications\n5. Propose specific improvements with rationale\n\nPATTERNS TO IDENTIFY:\n- Monolithic vs Microservice patterns\n- Layered vs Clean Architecture\n- Event-driven vs Request-response patterns\n- Database design patterns\n- Caching and performance patterns",
